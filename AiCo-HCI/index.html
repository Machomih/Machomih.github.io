      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        AiCo application is dedicated to air soft enjoyers who who want to have an easier experience on the field and improve teamwork. 
        The application would provide capabilities to make reservations, divide into teams, enter voice chats, track your performance, track your ammunition,
        improve the orientation through a compass displayed on main screen and possibility to send SOS signals to teammates. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The application is available on mobile phone with full features and on smartwatch devices with limited features that include: compass, ammo track, sos signal and kill/death signal.
      
      </p>
      <p>
        my high-level goals are to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To provide a easy and enjoyable experience on the field.</li>
        <li>Be fully functioning on smartphones and smartwatches.</li>
        <li>Easier communication between teammates. </li>
        <li>To improve orientation on battlefield.</li>
        <li>User-friendly interface.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My scope is to digitalize the experience of a battlefield and help the consumers with easing the need to remember details about the game.
        Also, I aim to provide an easy way of reserving, matchmaking and calculating score for air soft business owners so that they can spend less time on the digital part of the business
        and more on the customer interaction and experience.

            a match of air soft. Due to recommendation of the staff there, he installed the AiCo app and figured immediately how everything works. He was pleased to see that the app shows a preview of the filed and 
            more details about the main missions of the game. Also, when he entered on the voice channel his team created, he felt like in a real life battlefield.
          </p>

            He enters details about the ammo got and checks the signal send on smartwatch app for when the game starts. After many kills and deaths, he sees that the time for current session is gone.
            Back to the waiting rom, he checks the score in the app and finds out that being good at CS:GO is not the same as being good at a real-life situation but determined to do a comeback he and his friends reserve another game next week.
